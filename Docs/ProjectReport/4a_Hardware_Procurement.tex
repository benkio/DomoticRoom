\labelsec{Hardware Procurement}

Unfortunately one of the first problem in this project consist in buy the right hardware. So we searched for the right packs of sensors, resistors, wires and stuff for the building of a hardware configuration to satisfy the requirements.

\subsection{Computational Device}

First of all we need a computational device that can be connected to a large bunch of sensors and fully programmable. In the course we see two possibilities in this sense:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Arduino
  \item Raspberry Pi 2 model B
\end{itemize}

We choose the second one because we have more familiarity with that and because it can be more easily recycled at the end of this project, by one of us, for other jobs.

the price is 44,50 \euro

\subsection{Sensors}

We need enough sensor in order to capture the parameters in the requirement, so we choose this sensors:

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\cline{1-1}
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Environment Parameter}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Sensor}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Cost}} \\ \cline{1-1}
Temperature / Humidity                               &                                     &                                   \\
Light                                                &                                     &                                   \\
Sound                                                &                                     &                                  
\end{tabular}

\label{Sensor Table}
\end{table}

\subsection{Addictional Hardware}

At the end we need also some support for electrical circuits and for resistors, needed for the properly connection between sensors and Raspberry Pi.

\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Hardware}} &  & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Cost}} \\
Breadboard                            &  &                                   \\
Wires                                 &  &                                   \\
Resistors                             &  &
